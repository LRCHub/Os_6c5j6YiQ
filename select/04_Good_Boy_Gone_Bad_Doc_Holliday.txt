Well, I try to be a good boy all of the time
I can't help the way I am
I like to drink my whiskey
Talking to a Dixie girl
I ain't always been a winner baby
I have been known to lose a few
When it comes down to loving
What's a poor boy supposed to do

I'm a good boy, good boy gone bad
I'm a good boy, good boy gone bad

I found a lady and I fell in love
Doing like a good man should
I told her I was crazy
She told me that she understood
Now I'm back in town
With a honky tonk honey
In a juke joint down the road
Bless my soul. You should have seen her rock and roll

I'm a good boy, good boy gone bad
Yes, I'm a good boy, good boy gone bad

So good

Well, you can take me out of the country
But I'll always be a country boy
I've seen your city
It ain't too pretty
You know my momma didn't raise no fool
I've got a good woman on my mind
But, if you're talking about a kid
A good boy is hard to find

Ask me
I'm a good boy, good boy gone bad
I'm just a good boy, good boy gone bad

Oh good
Good boy gone bad
I'm a good boy, good boy
Good boy gone bad
Good boy gone bad
